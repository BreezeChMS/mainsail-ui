![captain America](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30707961/114431656-bdaf2c00-9b8d-11eb-96d6-d48d25015511.png)

There's a few necessary things we should go over first.

## Environment Setup

**Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BreezeChMS/mainsail-ui.git
```

**Install the depenedencies**

```
cd mainsail-ui

yarn install
```

**Start Storybook**

```
yarn start
```

You should now have storybook running with a message in your terminal similar to:

```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────╮

│   Read full changelog: https://git.io/fhFYe       │
│                                                   │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

## Project Overview

There are two primary portions of the Mainsail-UI dev environment.

1. [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction) - internally bundled by Webpack
2. React Component development - bundled by Rollup

#### What's in the `src` folder?

The majority of the development of components will take place in the `src` folder.

```
src
├─ assets
|  ├─ fonts (for use locally in storybook - not bundled)
|  └─ icons (original source svgs - has icon build process)
├─ components
├─ docs (for storybook documentation only)
├─ styles (global scss files)
|  ├─ Colors.scss   (color-related configurations)
|  ├─ Layout.scss   (utility classes for spacing/layout)
|  ├─ Reset.scss    (a reset used in storybook rendering)
|  ├─ Text.scss     (text-related configurations)
|  ├─ Utility.scss  (mixins used throughout scss)
|  └─ Variables.scss(all global scss variables)

```

## Configure Your Editor

The next big step requires its own section and comes highly recommended if you want the best development experience.

See [Configuring Your Editor](/docs/development/editor-config/)

Note: Currently only VS Code instructions exist. If plugins exist for your preferred editor, please submit a PR to update these docs.

## Review Some Project Design Decisions
