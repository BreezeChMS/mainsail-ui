# Configuring Your Editor

-   [VS Code Setup](#setup-for-vs-code-img-srchttpsuser-imagesgithubusercontentcom30707961107785711-ed22f300-6d1a-11eb-8c7f-c78bde3d014dpng-styledisplay-inline-width20-)

To aid in consistency and accuracy, Mainsail-UI utilizes [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/).

To get the most out of these, we (strongly) **recommend** you use an editor that supports [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) usage via plugins. This will allow you to format on save and see realtime feedback about what may possibly be wrong with your code.

## Setup for VS Code <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30707961/107785711-ed22f300-6d1a-11eb-8c7f-c78bde3d014d.png" style={{display: "inline"}} width="20" />

Once you run `yarn install` on the project, you should have the necessary linters and plugins for the project **but** you will still need to **install the editor plugins** to enable operation during editing.

## Install the Editor Plugins

-   [ESlint Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint): recommended for linting VS Code.
-   [Prettier Plugin](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode): recommended for _format on save_ functionality.
-   [Jest Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest): recommended for inline test running

Once installed (an app restart may be necessary), you should see linting take place inline and this can also be confirmed by opening your terminal with <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>~</kbd> and you should see the **PROBLEMS** tab display output (if there's an actual issue). You can test this by naming a prop wrong (see previous screen).

**Example**

**Inline Example**

Boolean prop type naming is enforced by eslint.

Also using the official [Jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) plugin will give you the ability to run your `<component>.test.js`
files inline while coding without having to do any extra effort. This will result in highlighting any failures on the fly.

# Troubleshooting ðŸš¨

## I've got nothing going on (ESLINT / PRETTIER)

**Did you install the plugin for VS Code?**

If you have any issues seeing linting support during your editor workflow, check the **OUTPUT** tab in the VS Coded Terminal as it will usually display any conflicts and issues that arise.

**Is the installed (and enabled plugin) set to run `onType` or `onSave`?**
