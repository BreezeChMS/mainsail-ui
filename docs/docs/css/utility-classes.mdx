# CSS Utilities

Mainsail comes with a few utility classes for working within the Mainsail design specs.

## Why Utility Classes?

Adding bespoke CSS per component for things that are constantly repeated adds to the "append-only" nature and unnecessary size of our CSS footprint.

Applying the 80/20 principle, having these classes available helps us to get the 80% done with 20% of the code. (Where the 80% is common use cases for positioning, layout and style ... and the 20% can likely be reused throughout the app.)

### Eww, how are these better than inline styles?

Utility classes are a fairly common styling pattern that offers [many benefits over inline styles](https://frontstuff.io/no-utility-classes-arent-the-same-as-inline-styles).

The utilities listed on this page are modeled after the very popular [Tailwind CSS](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/css-frameworks/).
There are a number of differences, however. For example, not everything has responsive class designations baked-in. Mainsail only includes a small subset of the abilities of Tailwind to save on bundle size.
