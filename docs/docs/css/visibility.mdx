<div className="body-text mb-20">
    <h3>Visible at Specific Breakpoints</h3>
    <div className="flex col mb-20">
        <div className="p-48 bg-blue-primary text-white sm:visible">
            sm:visible
        </div>
        <div className="p-48 bg-red-middle text-white md:visible">
            md:visible
        </div>

    <h3>Hidden at Specific Breakpoints</h3>
    <div className="flex col space-y-8">
        <div className="p-48 bg-blue-primary text-white sm:hidden">
            sm:hidden (shown at everything but sm)
        </div>
        <div className="p-48 bg-red-middle text-white md:hidden">
            md:hidden (shown at everything but md)
        </div>
        <div className="p-48 bg-green-middle text-white lg:hidden">
            lg:hidden (shown at everything but lg)
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
These work according to the following chart:

| Class specifier | Pixels              |
| --------------: | ------------------- |
|      sm:visible | Visible only at sm- |
|      md:visible | Visible only at md  |
|      lg:visible | Visible only at lg+ |
|       sm:hidden | Hides at sm-        |
|       md:hidden | Hides at md         |
|       lg:hidden | Hides at lg+        |

While a few hiding (<code>display: none</code>) helpers exist (shown above), you may be better suited to conditionally unmount components at breakpoints using a `useBreakpoint` hook .

:::tip
Note: `import { useBreakpoint } from "mainsail-ui"` â€” This hook can be used to provide responsive reactivity in JS components, but should be used at a higher level if possible because it responds to window resizing and should be used sparingly.
