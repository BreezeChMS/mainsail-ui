# Mainsail Tip 'o the week

Modal sizing is primarily controlled by content. This means you only need to concern yourself with the size of the body.
As such, it includes an optional prop called bodyWidth (and bodyHeight though rarely needed) that supports passing an array of sizes in for the 3 breakpoints we use in our app.

⚡️ See a demo of a responsive Modal setup [here on Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/mainsail-responsive-modal?file=src/App.js).
