# Mainsail Tip 'o the week

When using the new `<Icon />` from Mainsail-ui, you may find a special edge case that needs a different color than the 3 blues available from the color prop.

You're in luck, because `className` works as an escape hatch with our [CSS Utility Class](/docs/css/colors) colors for text.

```jsx
// Only offers 3 choices (light, default, dark), that cover most implementations
<Icon color="light" name="delete"/>

// Use a css utility class instead, will override the svg's color
<Icon className="text-red-dark" name="delete"/>
```

Because sometimes you just need a red trash can.
