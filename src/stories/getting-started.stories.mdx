import { Meta, Canvas } from "@storybook/addon-docs/blocks";
import { Button } from "../components/Button";
import { Icon } from "../components/Icon";

# Getting Started

Import the component. Use the component.

```jsx
import { Button } from "mainsail-ui";

<Button text="Look at me" />;
```

# Usage

Mainsail UI provides some common conventions for developer experience and happiness.

## Variants

When a component has a broad selection of different styles available, these styles will be available under the **variant** property.

```jsx
<Button variant="primary" />
<Button variant="secondary" />
<Button variant="tertiary" />
```

<Canvas>
    <Button text="Button" variant="primary" />
    <Button text="Button" variant="secondary" />
    <Button text="Button" variant="tertiary" />
</Canvas>

## Intent vs Colors

Some components (icons for example) have a small variety of colors available to use. These are accessed via the **color** prop.

Most components are designed for Mainsail-ui to be used in very specific use cases.

For context-specific coloring, the **intent** prop is used. Unlike a holistic style prop of **variant**, the _intent_ prop is _intended_ ðŸ˜‰ to be used to color a particular component variant for a particular use case.

_Note: In the case where any prop value is `default`, it can be omitted_

**Examples**

```jsx
// Using Intent
<Button intent="default" text="Safe to Press" />
<Button intent="danger" text="Dragons Ahead!" />

```

<Canvas>
    <Button intent="default" text="Safe to Press" />
    <Button intent="danger" text="Dragons Ahead!" />
</Canvas>

```jsx
// Using Colors
<Icon name="text" color="default"/>
<Icon name="text" color="light"/>
<Icon name="text" color="dark"/>
```

<Canvas>
    <Icon name="text" color="default" />
    <Icon name="text" color="light" />
    <Icon name="text" color="dark" />
</Canvas>

## ENUM prop values (Recommended)

Like many modern component libraries, utilizing [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) helps development along by throwing errors to your console if you pass an improper type to a component prop. While this is true of Mainsail, you can also utilize exposed ENUM prop values for each component.

The **exported ENUMS** object is namespaced for each component **by component name**.

So the ENUMS for the `<Icon/>` component are available under `ENUMS.Icon.<prop_name>.<prop_value>`.

**Example**

```jsx
import { Icon, ENUMS } from "mainsail-ui";

<Icon name={ENUMS.Icon.names.calendar} color={ENUMS.Icon.colors.light} />;
```

#### Why do this?

Utilizing these constants in this way, not only reduce the number of [magic strings](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/365339/what-is-wrong-with-magic-strings) in your codebase, but also make remembering the various prop values easy since most code editors and IDEs will provide auto-completion for such imported objects.

It might look more verbose at first, but **here are some benefits**:

1. Less cognitive overhead for remember props and their values
1. Strings are prone to typos whereas improperly typed constants should fail compilation
1. IDE Support of auto-completion
1. Easier to change the value of the prop if the library introduces new values
1. Find and replace becomes easier if necessary
