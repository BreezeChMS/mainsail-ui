# Using Mainsail as a CSS-Only Library

ðŸš¨ **If you're looking to get started with the React Library [go here!](?path=/story/react-getting-started--page)** ðŸš¨

This page is only for those looking to use the **css-only** version of Mainsail UI.

# Usage

You may use the Mainsail CSS library externally from the [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) cdn.

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://unpkg.com/mainsail-ui/dist/css/mainsail.min.css"
/>
```

A specific release version can be specified by following the conventions listed at [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com).

```html
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://unpkg.com/mainsail-ui@<version>/dist/css/mainsail.min.css"
/>
```
